      definitions: "The top section displays the feature's type. The middle section contains *fields* showing the feature's attributes, such as its name or address."
      type_h: "Feature Type"
      type: "You can press the feature type to change the feature to a different type. Everything that exists in the real world can be added to OpenStreetMap, so there are thousands of feature types to choose from."
      type_picker: "The type picker displays the most common feature types, such as parks, hospitals, restaurants, roads, and buildings. You can search for anything by typing what you're looking for in the search box. You can also press the {inspect} **Info** icon next to the feature type to learn more about it."
      fields_h: "Fields"
      fields_all_fields: "The \"{fields}\" section contains all of the feature's details that you may edit. In OpenStreetMap, all of the fields are optional, and it's OK to leave a field blank if you are unsure."
      fields_example: "Each feature type will display different fields. For example, a road may display fields for its surface and speed limit, but a restaurant may display fields for the type of food it serves and the hours it is open."
      fields_add_field: "You can also use the \"Add field\" dropdown to add more fields, such as a description, Wikipedia link, wheelchair access, and more."
      tags_h: "Tags"
      tags_all_tags: "Below the fields section, you can expand the \"{tags}\" section to edit any of the OpenStreetMap *tags* for the selected feature. Each tag consists of a *key* and *value*, data elements that define all of the features stored in OpenStreetMap."

      add_line: "To add a line, press the {line_icon} **{line}** button on the toolbar above the map, or press the shortcut key `{add_line_key}`."
      add_line_draw: "Next, mark the line's starting location. With a mouse, position the cursor where the line should begin and {mouse_left_icon} left-click to place a node. On a touchscreen, {onefinger_tap_icon} tap the location."
      add_line_continue: "Continue placing nodes by {mouse_left_icon} clicking or {onefinger_tap_icon} tapping along the shape of the line. While drawing, you can zoom in or drag the map in order to add more detail."
      add_line_finish: "To finish a line, click or tap on the last node again or press `{return}`."
      modify_line_h: "Modifying Lines"
      modify_line_dragnode: "Often you'll see lines that aren't shaped correctly, for example a road that does not match up with the background imagery. To adjust the shape of a line, first select it. All nodes of the line will be drawn as small circles. You can then drag the nodes to better locations."
      modify_line_addnode: "You can also create new nodes along a line by {mouse_left_icon}x2 double-clicking or {onefinger_tap_icon}x2 double-tapping the line, or by dragging the small triangles at the midpoints between nodes."
      connect_line_h: "Connecting Lines"
      connect_line: "Having roads connected properly is important for the map and essential for providing driving directions."
      connect_line_display: "The connections between roads are drawn with gray circles. The endpoints of a line are drawn with larger white circles if they don't connect to anything."
      connect_line_drag: "To connect a line to another feature, drag one of the line's nodes onto the other feature until both features snap together. Tip: You can hold down the `{option}` key to prevent nodes from connecting to other features."
      connect_line_tag: "If you know that the connection has traffic lights or crosswalks, you can add them by selecting the connecting node and using the feature editor to select the correct feature's type."

      move_line_command: "To move an entire line, {mouse_right_icon} right-click the line and choose the {move_icon} **{move}** operation from the edit menu. Then move the mouse, and {mouse_left_icon} left-click to place the line in a new location."
      move_line_connected: "Lines that are connected to other features will stay connected as you move the line to a new location. Rapid may prevent you from moving a line across another connected line."
      delete_line_h: "Deleting Lines"
      delete_line: "If a line is entirely incorrect, for example a road that doesn't exist in the real world, it's OK to delete it. Be careful when deleting features: the background imagery you are using might be outdated, and a road that looks wrong could simply be newly built."
      delete_line_command: "To delete a line, {mouse_right_icon} right-click or {onefinger_tap_and_hold_icon} long-press the line to show the edit menu, then use the {delete_icon} **{delete}** operation."
    areas:
      title: Areas
      intro: "*Areas* are used to show the boundaries of features like lakes, buildings, and residential areas. Areas should be traced around the edge of the feature that they represent, for example, around the base of a building."
      point_or_area_h: "Points or Areas?"
      point_or_area: "Many features can be represented as points or areas. You should map buildings and property outlines as areas whenever possible. Place points inside a building area to represent businesses, amenities, and other features located inside the building."
      add_area_h: "Adding Areas"
      add_area_command: "To add an area, press the {area_icon} **{area}** button on the toolbar above the map, or press the shortcut key `{add_area_key}`."
      add_area_draw: "Next, place the first corner of the area. With a mouse, position the cursor over any corner and {mouse_left_icon} left-click to place a node. On a touchscreen, {onefinger_tap_icon} tap the location."
      add_area_continue: "Continue placing nodes by {mouse_left_icon} clicking or {onefinger_tap_icon} tapping along the edge of the area. While drawing, you can zoom in or drag the map in order to add more detail."
      add_area_finish: "To finish an area, click or tap on the first or last node again or press `{return}`."
      square_area_h: "Square Corners"
      square_area_command: "Many area features like buildings have square corners. To square the corners of an area, {mouse_right_icon} right-click or {onefinger_tap_and_hold_icon} long-press the edge of the area and choose the {orthogonalize_icon} **{orthogonalize}** operation from the edit menu."
      modify_area_h: "Modifying Areas"
      modify_area_dragnode: "Often you'll see areas that aren't shaped correctly, for example a building that does not match up with the background imagery.

      modify_area_addnode: "You can also create new nodes along an area by {mouse_left_icon}x2 double-clicking or {onefinger_tap_icon}x2 double-tapping an edge, or by dragging the small triangles at the midpoints between nodes."
      delete_area_h: "Deleting Areas"
      delete_area: "If an area is entirely incorrect, for example a building that doesn't exist in the real world, it's OK to delete it. Be cautious when deleting features - the background imagery you are using might be outdated, and a building that looks wrong could simply be newly built."
      delete_area_command: "To delete an area, {mouse_right_icon} right-click or {onefinger_tap_and_hold_icon} long-press the area to show the edit menu, then use the {delete_icon} **{delete}** operation."
    relations:
      title: Relations
      intro: "A *relation* is a special type of feature in OpenStreetMap that groups together other features. The features that belong to a relation are called *members*, and each member can have a *role* in the relation."
      edit_relation_h: "Editing Relations"
      edit_relation: "At the bottom of the feature editor, you can expand the \"{relations}\" section to see if the selected feature is a member of any relations. You can then select a relation to edit it."
      edit_relation_add: "To add a feature to a relation, select the feature, then press the {plus} add button in the \"{relations}\" section of the feature editor. You can choose from a list of nearby relations, or choose the \"{new_relation}\" option."
      edit_relation_delete: "You can also press the {delete_icon} **{delete}** button to remove the selected feature from the relation. If you remove all of the members from a relation, the relation will be deleted automatically."
      maintain_relation_h: "Maintaining Relations"
      maintain_relation: "For the most part, Rapid will maintain relations automatically as you edit. You should take care when replacing features that might be members of relations. For example if you delete a section of road and draw a new section of road to replace it, you should add the new section to the same relations (routes, turn restrictions, etc.) as the original."
      relation_types_h: "Relation Types"
      multipolygon_h: "Multipolygons"
      multipolygon: "A *multipolygon* relation is a group of one or more *outer* features and one or more inner features. The outer features define the outer edges of the multipolygon, and the inner features define sub-areas or holes cut out from the inside of the multipolygon."
      multipolygon_create: "To create a multipolygon, for example a building with a hole in it, draw the outer edge as an area and the inner edge as a line or different kind of area. Then `{shift}`+{mouse_left_icon} left-click to select both features, {mouse_right_icon} right-click to show the edit menu, and choose the {merge_icon} **{merge}** operation."
      multipolygon_merge: "Merging several lines or areas will create a new multipolygon relation with all selected areas as members. Rapid will choose the inner and outer roles automatically, based on which features are contained inside other features."
      turn_restriction_h: "Turn restrictions"
      turn_restriction: "A *turn restriction* relation is a group of several road segments in an intersection. Turn restrictions consist of a *from* road, *via* node or roads, and a *to* road."
      turn_restriction_field: "To edit turn restrictions, select a junction node where two or more roads meet. The feature editor will display a special \"{turn_restrictions}\" field containing a model of the intersection."
      turn_restriction_editing: "In the \"{turn_restrictions}\" field, select a \"from\" road, and see whether turns are allowed or restricted to any of the \"to\" roads. You can press the turn icons to toggle them between allowed and restricted. Rapid will create relations automatically and set the from, via, and to roles based on your choices."
      route_h: "Routes"
      route: "A *route* relation is a group of one or more line features that together form a route network, like a bus route, train route, or highway route."
      route_add: "To add a feature to a route relation, select the feature and scroll down to the \"{relations}\" section of the feature editor, then press the {plus} add button to add this feature to a nearby existing relation or a new relation."
      boundary_h: "Boundaries"
      boundary: "A *boundary* relation is a group of one or more line features that together form an administrative boundary."

      intro: "*Operations* are special commands you can use to edit features. {mouse_right_icon} Right-click or {onefinger_tap_and_hold_icon} long-press any feature to view the available operations."
      intro_2: "Each operation has its own keyboard shortcut. Most operations can be applied to multiple features at once."
      straighten: "{straighten_icon} **{straighten}** removes bends from lines. It can also align groups of points into neat rows."
      orthogonalize: "{orthogonalize_icon} **{orthogonalize}** snaps the corners of areas and lines to 90°. You can square individual corners or entire features."
      circularize: "{circularize_icon} **{circularize}** turns areas and closed lines into circles."
      move: "{move_icon} **{move}** lets you drag features around the map."
      rotate: "{rotate_icon} **{rotate}** lets you swivel features around their center points."
      reflect: "{reflect_short_icon} **{reflect_short}** and {reflect_long_icon} **{reflect_long}** reflect features over their short and long axes."
      continue: "{continue_icon} **{continue}** lets you extend existing lines from their endpoints."
      reverse: "{reverse_icon} **{reverse}** changes the direction of features. The direction matters for things like one-way roads, traffic signs, waterways, and cliffs."
      disconnect: "{disconnect_icon} **{disconnect}** separates connected lines and areas from each other. You can disconnect entire features or just selected points."
      merge: "{merge_icon} **{merge}** combines multiple features into one. You can merge areas together to create multipolygons, merge lines together to create longer lines, and merge points into anything to transfer their tags."
      split: "{split_icon} **{split}** divides lines at the selected points. If specific lines are also selected, only those are split."
      extract: "{extract_icon} **{extract}** detaches points from lines. It also pulls points out of buildings and other areas."
      delete: "{delete_icon} **{delete}** removes features from the map. Anything that doesn't exist in the real world should be deleted."
      downgrade: "{downgrade_icon} **{downgrade}** removes most tags except building and address info. This is helpful when businesses close yet their facilities remain."
      copy_paste: "{copy_icon} **{copy}** and {paste_icon} **{paste}** let you duplicate features."
    notes:
      title: Notes

      save_note: "You must save any note edits individually by pressing the buttons below the note comments. Note edits are **not** included in changesets that you upload to OpenStreetMap."
    imagery:
      title: Background Imagery
      intro: "The background imagery that appears beneath the map data is an important resource for mapping. This imagery can be aerial photos collected from satellites, airplanes, and drones, or it can be scanned historical maps or other freely available source data."
      sources_h: "Imagery Sources"
      choosing: "To see which imagery sources are available for editing, open the {layers_icon} **{background_settings}** panel on the side of the map."
      sources: "The [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps/) satellite layer or the best local imagery is set as the default background. Depending on where you are editing, multiple imagery sources are available. Some may be newer or have higher resolution, so it is always useful to check and see which layer is the best one to use as a mapping reference."
      offsets_h: "Adjusting Imagery Offset"
      offset: "Imagery is sometimes offset slightly from accurate map data. If you see a lot of roads or buildings shifted from the background imagery, it may be the imagery that's incorrect, so don't move them all to match the background. Instead, you can adjust the background so that it matches the existing data by expanding the \"{imagery_offset}\" section at the bottom of the Background Settings pane."
      offset_change: "Press the small triangle buttons to adjust the imagery offset in small steps, or hold the {mouse_left_icon} left mouse button and drag within the gray square to slide the imagery into alignment."
    streetlevel:
      title: Street Level Photos
      intro: "Street level photos are useful for mapping traffic signs, businesses, and other details that you can't see from satellite and aerial images. The Rapid editor supports street level photos from [Bing Streetside](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/streetside), [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com), and [KartaView](https://www.kartaview.org)."
      using_h: "Using Street Level Photos"
      using: "To use street level photos for mapping, open the {data_icon} **{map_data}** panel on the side of the map to enable or disable the available photo overlays."
      photos: "When enabled, the photo overlay displays a line along the sequence of photos. At higher zoom levels, a circle marks at each photo location, and at even higher zoom levels, a cone indicates the direction the camera was facing when the photo was taken."
      viewer: "When you select one of the photo locations, a photo viewer appears in the bottom corner of the map.

      using: "To use a GPS trace for mapping, drag and drop the data file onto the map editor. If it's recognized, it will be drawn on the map as a bright purple line. Open the {data_icon} **{map_data}** panel on the side of the map to enable, disable, or zoom to your GPS data."
      tracing: "The GPS track isn't sent to OpenStreetMap - the best way to use it is to draw on the map, using it as a guide for the new features that you add."
