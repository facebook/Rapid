# Contributing to Rapid

## Translations

Translations are managed using the [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) platform.

1. Create an an account on Transifex.
2. Visit Rapid's project page here: https://www.transifex.com/rapid-editor/rapid-editor/
3. Optional: You can click the "eyeball" icon to watch the project and get notified when there are new translations needed.
4. Select a language and click **Translate** to get started!

üëâ Important:  Any words in brackets, for example `{name}`, are placeholders and should not be translated.
For example, a French translation of `Couldn't locate a place named '{name}'` might look like
`Impossible de localiser l'endroit nomm√© '{name}'`.

Translations are licensed under [ISC](LICENSE.md), the same license as Rapid.

## Forking, cloning, and running Rapid
This section suggests a toolset and method to start contributing to Rapid. However, you are welcome to use your own tools for the job. Here's what you could use:

| Tool | Suggestion | Alternatives |
|---|---|---|
| üü© Node version manager | [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) | [fish](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/nvm.fish), [n](https://github.com/tj/n), [volta](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta) |
| üìù Text editor | [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) | [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) |
| üßë‚Äçüíª POSIX-compliant CLI | [Bash for Linux](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) | [WSL for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), [Zsh the OSX default](https://www.zsh.org/) |
| üåê Web browser | [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) | [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) |

### Setting up Rapid locally
1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository from [facebook/Rapid](https://github.com/facebook/Rapid) to your own GitHub account.
2. [Clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) with `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/Rapid.git`.
3. From the CLI, open your freshly cloned Rapid directory by running the command `code Rapid`
4. Once in VSCode, type **Ctrl+Shift+`** to open a terminal. Alternatively, use the **Terminal>New Terminal** menu option.
5. Make sure you are using [the latest `node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download) by running `node --version`. If not, then running `nvm install node` will set it up for you.
6. Install all required dependencies with `npm install`
7. Then run `npm run all` to set up Rapid.
8. Finally, run `npm run start` to start the server on port 8080.

Congrats! üéâ You should now be able to use rapid by navigating to [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/) on Chrome.

### Setting up the VSCode debugger
VSCode provides a debugging mode using Chrome. To use it, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Run>Add Configuration** and select `{} Chrome: Launch`
2. This will create `launch.json`.
3. Make sure to add the `/dist/` path to `webRoot` and change `localhost` to `127.0.0.1` on `url`, so that the file looks like this:
```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Chrome against localhost",
            "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
            "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/dist/"
        }
    ]
}
```

Great! You should now be able to run the Rapid server with `npm run start` and then the debugger by either pressing **F5** on your keyboard, or clicking on **Run>Start Debugging**.

This will launch Chrome on whatever address you provided to `url` on `launch.json`, allowing you to use Rapid as well as entering debugging mode on VSCode.

> **Note:** Again, you are welcome to try your own debugging method, such as [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/breakpoints/).


## Directory structure

Now that you know how to set up, run and debug Rapid, you will probably want a tour of the directory structure. This should help you know where to add any new features, or where to spot a particular bug in need of fixing.

Here are the relevant parts of the directory tree along with short descriptions of each directory:

- `css`: It contains the `.css` for styling things like the sidebars, top bars, buttons, etc. Note that there is no `.css` 'inside' the map itself - That's all styled using WebGL.
- `data`: Static data files that define the imagery, data formats, language resources, and walkthrough data. 
- `dist`: Where all the built artifacts get served from. 
- `docs`: The 'docs' directory is populated each time you execute 'npm run doc,' making it a valuable resource for documentation-related tasks.
- `modules`: The 'modules' directory is the heart of our codebase, housing the majority of the substantial code. Module subdirectories are: 
    - `actions`: Discrete modifications to the map state - Changing tags, moving a node, rotating a shape, scaling a polygon, these are all 'actions'.  Actions are only fired when the user changes the map. 
    - `behaviors`: Bundles of event handlers that can apply to different modes (see `modes` below). Behaviors include **Drag**, **Draw**, **Hover**, **Select**, and **Paste**.
    - `core`:  It's where a lot of our `Systems` live. Systems are fundamental building blocks of Rapid. For example, the **EditSystem** is where all the edits to the map are handled and kept track of, the **UrlHashSystem** keeps track of any changes/updates to the URL in the url bar, and the **MapSystem** is what sets up the Map and starts the WebGL renderer going. 
    - `geo`: Geospatial/Geometric code used for transforming map entities. Most of this code now lives in an SDK called the `rapid-sdk`, which you will see referenced throughout. Need to calculate the center of a bunch of geometric points? the `rapid-sdk` has code for that. 
    - `modes`: These describe what the user is doing at the moment - They may be browsing, selecting, drawing a polygon, saving, or dragging a node.
    - `operations`: Operation are for discrete edits on the map - Using a hotkey to flip a polygon upside down, or right-clicking a square entity and selecting 'circularize' are two different operations. Right-clicking an entity on the map will show you many operations that are appropriate for that entity. 
    - `osm`: This is where the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data model is defined: ways, nodes, tags, etc. Any time your code is dealing with a node or way information, it's using the code from this folder.
    - `pixi`: Contains all the [Pixi](https://pixijs.download/dev/docs/index.html) renderer code. 
    - `services`: Where we fetch data from other places - OSM data is loaded via the OSM Service. There are many services for different types of imagery/data.
    - `ui`: Where all the UI code is kept. There is code for the sidebars, top bars, Rapid button, color pickers, and a lot lot more.
    - `util`: Assorted utility functions. A bit of a random grab-bag. Almost every codebase seems to have one of these. üôÇ 
    - `validations`: As the mapper makes edits, this folder contains the code that runs automated validations on their changes and flags any issues. It's kind of like a code linter, but for map data.
- `svg`: Where all the SVG icons live - Anytime you see an icon in the map, or in the sidebars/UI, it comes from here!
